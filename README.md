# Gorilla Tag Source
Full gorilla tag source code, made for modders on standalone quest 2. I don't understand that much of it, so hopefully some young padawan will edit it to finally make standalone quest gorilla tag mods possible.

If anyone knows how to do this, reach out to me at creedautomatorcentral@gmail.com. Know that I'll read anything you send me, and will try my best to incorporate any ideas you may have.

If you know anyone who is good at coding and plays GTag, let them know about this project, so (fingers crossed) they can help me modify this code to make mods accessible for everyone, not just those with a PC and $20, also tell them to reach out at creedautomatorcentral@gmail.com.

FYI, Github's free edition won't let me upload all of the files directly onto this repo, so I'm using Google Drive Instead. Link: 




It sucks that the best VR game ever made gives an unfair advantage to only those lucky few with mods.

Let's change that.
